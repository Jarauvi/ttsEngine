# SherpaTTS - Esa Pakarinen Edition
This is a fork of awesome [SherpaTTS](https://github.com/woheller69/ttsEngine) by woheller69!

I wanted to allow the use of this specific custom [Esa Pakarinen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esa_Pakarinen) piper model as a navigator voice more easily than sending it to the phone using ADB, so I decided to create small startup script that copies the custom model in-place to modelDir when app is started at the first time.

Model cannot be changed to another or it is lost and reinstall is needed.

Model is used to convert the Finnish voice instructions of [Organic Maps](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps) to god tier [Savonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savonian_people) accent! Check out [that repository](https://github.com/Jarauvi/organicmaps)
